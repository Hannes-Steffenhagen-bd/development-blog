#+TITLE: Betterdoc Development Blog

* What is this?
This is supposed to be my take at a blog to log stuff I do at BetterDoc. To make
that fun the idea will be to use Hakyll as the basic site generator, Milligram
as a "base" css defaults set, some custom CSS for nav rules, and when the basic
stuff is working I also want to add some functionality like "live search" and
such via purescript.

As of now none of that is implemented but once it is the idea would be to have
github actions to create a ~gh-pages~ branch from this one (which will remain
the source branch).

* Todos
** TODO Create basic hakyll setup
Basically, just have a simple html template, at least one markdown document
that's generated based on that template, and spit out a site that github pages understands.
** TODO Set up Github Actions workflow
Once basic setup is in place, create github actions to automatically compile&push results to the gh-actions branch
